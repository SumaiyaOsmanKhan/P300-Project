## Project Details

This project can be divided into two parts.Frontend & backend.In frontend we will set up our outlooking website.It will build a nice UI for the user and make the website more user friendly. For making our frontend UI more beautiful we will use React & Redux.React is a User Interface (UI) library.React is a tool for building UI components.On the other hand Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to test. While it's mostly used as a state management tool with React.In the backend we will use node js & express.For our database management system we will use GraphQl & mongo DB combined.
